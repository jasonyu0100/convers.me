“The Shape in the Clearing”
In the twilight of a forgotten forest, where the trees whispered secrets older than time, something stirred beneath the moss.

It began as a worm — small, soft, nearly nothing. But as the shadows deepened and the wind picked up a forgotten rhythm, it twisted. Crackled. Shifted.

A bird.
A fly.
A tiger.

Each form emerged like a memory clawing to be remembered. Bones rearranged themselves with a wet snap. Eyes blinked open only to vanish again.

Taylor crouched in the undergrowth, her breath held like glass between her ribs. She had planted the seed. She knew what it would become — or thought she did. It was hers, in the way wildfire belongs to the match.

Fang, her mentor, stood silently behind her, barely disturbing the leaves. His presence was like iron in the earth. Watching. Judging.

"You’ve waited long enough," he said. “Say ‘when,’ and it ends.”

"But what if it’s not ready?" she whispered. "What if I’m not?"

"It doesn't wait for you," Fang replied. "Nothing ever does."

In the clearing, the creature convulsed again. A fox. A fly. A demon.

Taylor’s heart pounded with a strange recognition.

The creature turned its gaze toward her, and in that fleeting instant, she saw herself.

Her doubt. Her desire. Her rage. Her brilliance.

The shape was not just a beast — it was possibility. Raw and unrefined. Dangerous. Beautiful.

“I made this,” she said, almost to herself.

“You are this,” Fang corrected. “Say when, and it becomes fixed. Useful. Real.”

But to define it meant to kill its potential.

To leave it meant it might consume her.

Taylor took a breath, stepped into the clearing, and whispered, “Not yet.”

And for a moment — just a moment — the forest pulsed with approval.
