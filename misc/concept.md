In a dimly lit forest, a worm squirmed and struggled. Its form morphed and crackled.

A bird. A fly. A tiger.

Some witchcraft run amock in the span of an hour.

Taylor watched from afar, eyes aghast. She had plant the seed. It was hers, but on borrowed time. Who knew when transfiguration would end.

When the next phase arrive? It would be abrupt.

Mentors said, to wait and see. And when the time was right, spring the trap.
Surround, encircle and expose to glaring rays of light. This was the art.

A tiger, an antelope, and now a bee. Fear crept.
Could it be?

"Sarah..."
You've been standing there for too long.

It was her mentor.
"You've done well now just say 'when', and it will be"

"Why not just let it linger Fang?"
"You could just leave it be. Then you'd be left without the control or the desire. So just say when."

A fox? A fly?
A demon.

It would make itself known.
