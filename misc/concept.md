In a dimly lit forest, a worm squirmed and struggled. Its form morphed and crackled.

A bird. A fly.

So witchcraft run amock in a span of an hour.

Taylor watched from afar, eyes aghast. She had planted the seed. It was hers, but on borrowed time.
Who knew when, transfiguration and the phase would come to abrupt ends.

"You've done well, now just say 'when' and it will happen."

"Why not let it linger, Fang?"

"You can just leave it be in that case, you'll be left without the control you desire."

"So just say when"

A fox? A fly? When would it be ready.

Now was the time for action.
